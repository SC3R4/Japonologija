	The Narrative of Female Protagonists in Taiwanese Buddhism

## A History of Women
- Religion in Taiwan as a narrative od female figures
- From Guanyin and Mazu to the famous nun Zhengyan
	- Founded a Buddhist NGO

- Taiwan as a "Guanyin daochang"

- Scholarship so far looked at Buddhist women before 1950s on Taiwan
	- Small Towns have small temples as opposed to our general view of grandiose buddhist temples
	- OBJECTIVE :
		- Rethinking history and agency in the development of Buddhism on the island -> Make the unheard of communities heard
	- EXAMPLE:
		- Nun Miaoqing (1901-1956) -> Yuangton chansi
		- Nun Xuanshen (1913-1990) -> Yitong nunnery (Xinzhu)
		- Both of these nuns are from Xinzhu

## Periphery as the New Centre
- Shifting attention from the centre to the peripgery
- Bringing the periphery to the centre
- Repositioning atcors in historical narrative
- Attention to space

## Preliminary Notes
- Co-existence of Chinese and Japanese Buddhism in Taiwan after 1895: cooperation or tensions?
	- Chinese buddhists had to act in a way that didn't make threaten japanese buddhism
- The monk Jueli (1881-1933)
- The Taiwanese Way of Diversity
	- Temples look like "Big malls of religion" with buddhist, daoist deities etc.
- Research methodology: attention to "non-emminent" players and redefiniton of "eminence"

## Studying Buddhist Women
	History as "His story"
- 8 rules which state that women and nuns are subordinate to the male counterparts
	- Chinese scholars looked at it as "Monks protecting and teaching nuns"
- Lack of (self-)awareness
	- Because of buddhist rules
	- Not much record kept of nuns and their work
- Nuns behind monks, nuns under monks
	- When interviewing, they never ask nuns how it was, the interviewers instead choose to ask the monks
- Visibility, invisibility, (in)visibility
	- Some of these communites fly under the radar, but are essential to society

## Being a Buddhist Woman in Taiwan
	It is very rare for buddhist women to write about themselves
- Temples of small communites were very poor
- The issue of monsatic ordination
- Alternative models of practice (and alternative identities/labels)
- Transition and transformation of sites and labels
- Spectrum of relations between buddhist women and buddhist monks

## The Four Mountains during Japanese Occupation
	Before 1931 the japanese allowed them to do their rituals
- The japanese say there are two type of monasti communities
	- Those who do it the chinese way
	- Those who allow women to have long hair?
- Benyuan (1883-1946)
	- Lingyun chansi (Taipei)
- Shanhui (1881-1945)
	- Lingquansi (Jilong)
- Jueli (1881-1933)
	- Fayunsi (Miaoli)
	- Pilu chansi (Taizhong)
		- Six sisters
	- Yuantong chansi (zhonghe)
		- Nun Miaoqing (1901-1956)
- Yongding (1877-1939)
	- Chaofengsi

## Alternatives to Monastic Ordination
- Becoind a "Vegetarian woman" zhaigu and caigu
- Japanese reports from the Colonial era: simiao and zhaitang
- Being a vegetarian woman was either a choice or the only choice
- Sites hosting both ordained nuns and alternative models
