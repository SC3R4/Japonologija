## What makes civil society?
	"Civil society is a boroad and elusive concept. It 
	refers to the organizational dimension of social life, 
	based on shared values, norms, and social networks among
	voluntary social groups, associations and organisations"
- Civil society consists of different civi society orhanisations (CSO):
	- Non-governmental organisations (NGO)/ not-for-profit organisations (NPO)
	- Community organisations (CO, e.g neighbourhood associations)
	- labour unions (e.g teachers, student unions)
	- faith-based and religious organisation (e.g churches)
	- advocacy groups (e.g environmental activists)
	- davocacy groups (e.g environmental activists)
	- professional organisations (e.g Lawyers associations)
	- research organisations/think-tanks (e.g citizens institutes) -> inÅ¡titu 8. Marec
- Civil initiatives (CI) are also a part of civil society, in contrast to CSO they focus on single and short term gials, they lack permanent organisation.
- Often the boundary between CSO and CI is unclear -> CSO can have multiples roles (e.g religious organisation can start a CI that later evolves into CO)
- Civil society originates in "public sphere" that emerged during Enlightenment
- Working class struggles and civil society -> Paris Commune 1871
- Expansion of civil society and social movements in the 1960s, Paris
- Growth of civil society and struggles for democratisation in the 1980s, Ljubljana

## Civil society and the state
	"Civil society is almost invariably defined in therms of its relatios to the state. Civil society is separate from and often in conflict with the state." - Kim Sunhyuk
- Civil society is considered the "third sector" of society along with the state and markets. ideally, civil society is separated and autonomous from the state.
- The state can engage with the civil society in different ways
	- oppresion (common in authoritarian regimes)
	- ignorance (lack of support fior CSO)
	- co-optation (using CSO to implement state agendas)
	- collaboration (throught engagement and partnerships with CSO)
- On one hand, civil society provides services for the state (e.g red cross, volunteering), on the other hand civil society challenges the state by advocating or citizens (e.g Environmental associations, LGBTQ+ groups)
- Civil society affects democracy, human rights and social justice by enabling citizens to organise, express their views and engage with the state
- Strong civil society is expected to foster civic engagement and empowers individuales and communities in a democratic society.
## Collective action and the state
- Collective action refers to the activities undertaken by a group that is working together towards a common goal or address shared interests.
